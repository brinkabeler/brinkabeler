### Moin 👋 

💻📓
I'm Martin, a freelance consultant in change management & organizational development often working closely with IT companies or departments. Check it out my [homepage](https://vernetztesarbeiten.de) you are interested. It's in German 🇩🇪, but I'm open to English 🇬🇧 speaking contacts.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects with tech, change management or organizational components
- 💬 Ask me about work culture, project pains, company structure stuff

I mainly use github to check out projects and sometimes provide feedback. I'm also testing github pages to build and serve my [homepage](https://vernetztesarbeiten.de) with hugo. 

📷🍜🍙⛩
Outside of work, you'll find me stolling around some city with a camera in my hand. Or checking out a new ramen spot. I live in Hamburg, Germany.
